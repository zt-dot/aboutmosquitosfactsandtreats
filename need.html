      There seems to be a debate about if mosquitoes are really needed on this earth. On one hand, they carry A LOT of diseases which cause the death of over 1 million people per year. The bites cause itchy bumps, people just don't really like them. But at the same time, not every mosquito like that. Most mosquitoes don't bite humans, and they serve as the food for many different animal species across the world. And most of them leave us alone. </p>
